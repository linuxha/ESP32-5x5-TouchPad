# ESP32-5x5-TouchPad

I found this ESP32-5x5-TouchPad board on Tindie and ordered two. Eventually I'll design my own but it's good to have something you can easily experiment with to do your research first. The company's web site is at [Electro Point4U](https://electropoint4u.com/product/esp32-touch-matrix/). There was no special reason I chose this one other that it was convient at the time. It did take time to ship from India.

And I found their code on github, which I forked here.
